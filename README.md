# Snake Game - Vanilla JavaScript

This is a simple **Snake Game** built with **vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS. The game features the classic mechanics of the snake, where you control the snake to eat food, grow in size, and avoid running into walls or yourself.

The project consists of the following files:
- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the game interface.
- `style.css` - The stylesheet for styling the game board and UI.
- `script.js` - The JavaScript file containing the game logic and functionality.
- `snake-game-ai-gen.png` - An image used for the game (could be the snake or background graphic).

## Features
- Classic Snake game mechanics.
- Arrow key controls to navigate the snake.
- The snake grows each time it eats food.
- The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
- Simple and responsive game design.
